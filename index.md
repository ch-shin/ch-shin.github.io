I am a fourth-year PhD student in Computer Science at University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Frederic Sala](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~fredsala/). Before that, I was a master's student at [Seoul National University](https://convergence.snu.ac.kr/), where I was lucky to learn deep learning, exploratory data analysis, and entrepreneurship from [Wonjong Rhee](https://drl.snu.ac.kr/people/professor). Prior to that, I received B.A in [Psychology](http://psych.snu.ac.kr/) and B.S. in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.snu.ac.kr/) from [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/).

My primary research interests lie in the field of machine learning and data science. I am working on weak supervision and data-centric AI. These days, I am mainly interested in inference time intervention using data geometry, statistics, and optimal transport.
