I am a first year PhD student in Computer Science at University of Wisconsin-Madison. Previously, I have done research on deep learning applications to energy data, mainly focusing on NILM (Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring) during my master’s degree studies and working as a data scientist in Encored Technologies. My current research interests lie in the field of deep learning, algorithms and computational learning theory. Specifically, I am interested in 1) connecting properties of deep neural networks and generalization bounds, 2) understanding transferable features and designing efficient transfer learning methods, 3) explaining the lottery ticket hypothesis in theoretical framework. Ultimately, my research goal is discovering effective design principles for deep neural networks.

### Work Experience

- Data Scientist, Deep Backend Team
- Projects: Deep Learning in NILM, Appliance Promotion based on Disaggregated Appliance Usage, Anomaly Detection in Solar Power Management System
- Working as a data scientist at Encored, I have gained extensive experience with software and data science. Before, I had thought that “great” algorithms alone are enough to solve many problems in real-world. However, I became deeply realized that there are a lot of troublesome steps to deploy ML products that work, and data really matters. With lessons from my experience in Encored, I want to pursue my doctoral course with the theme of how AI can overcome difficulties in real-world data problems in flexible and robust ways as humans.

- Researcher, Defense Information Planning Division
- Topics: Informatization Policy, Artificial Intelligence
- KIDA is a government-funded organization that performs research on all aspects of Korean defense policy. As my personal project in KIDA, I researched the medical application of AI at the policy level. It provided me a chance to ponder on the values of AI research and what it means for a specific technology to change the world from a macro perspective.
