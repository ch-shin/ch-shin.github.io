I am a fifth-year PhD student in Computer Science at University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Frederic Sala](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~fredsala/). Before that, I was a master's student at [Seoul National University](https://convergence.snu.ac.kr/), where I was lucky to learn deep learning, exploratory data analysis, and information theory from [Wonjong Rhee](https://drl.snu.ac.kr/people/professor). Prior to that, I received B.A in [Psychology](http://psych.snu.ac.kr/) and B.S. in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.snu.ac.kr/) from [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/).

My research focuses on data-centric AI, particularly programmatic weak supervision and weak-to-strong generalization in foundation models. I have also worked on zero-shot adaptation techniques to enhance robustification, alignment, and personalization of foundation models at inference time without fine-tuning.

Looking ahead, my overarching vision is to develop effective strategies for supervising superhuman-level intelligence, including large language models (LLMs) and multimodal models (MLLMs), where traditional human oversight becomes insufficient. As part of this vision, I am exploring weak-to-strong generalization as a core principle, alongside potential approaches such as scalable oversight—leveraging synthetic data and curriculum learning—and mechanisms for self-improvement and dynamic alignment during inference.
