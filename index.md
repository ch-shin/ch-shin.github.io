Hello!
I am a Data Scientist in Encored Technologies.
I have done research in deep learning applications to energy data, mainly focusing on NILM (Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring) during my master's degree studies and working as a data scientist in Encored Technologies. While my research projects have been focused on applying deep learning to energy data, I have a broad interest in deep learning, especially related with Human-Inspired Intelligence based on psychology, which was my undergraduate major.

### Experience

<h4 class="experience">
  <i class="material-icons md-18">apartment</i>
  <a href="enertalk.com">Encored Technologies</a>, Seoul, Korea
  <sup>2018.01 - Present</sup>
</h4>
- Data Scientist, Deep Backend Team
- Projects: Deep Learning in NILM, Appliance Promotion based on Disaggregated Appliance Usage, Anomaly Detection in Solar Power Management System
- Work as alternative military service
- Working in Encored as a data scientist was able to gain a lot of experience with software and data science. Before, I had thought that "great" algorithms alone are enough to solve many problems in real world. However, I became deeply realized that data really matters and there are a lot of troublesome steps to deploy ML products. With lessons from the experience, I want to pursue my doctoral course with the theme how AI can  overcome a lot of data problems in flexible and robust ways like human.

- Researcher, Defense Information Planning Division

- Work as alternative military service
- KIDA is a government-funded organization that performs research on all aspects of Korean defense policy. As my personal project in KIDA, I did research about the medical application of AI in the policy level. It provided me a chance to ponder on the values of AI research and what it means for a specific technology to change the world in a macro perspective.
