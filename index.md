I am a fifth-year PhD student in Computer Science at University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Frederic Sala](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~fredsala/). Before that, I was a master's student at [Seoul National University](https://convergence.snu.ac.kr/), where I was lucky to learn deep learning, exploratory data analysis, and information theory from [Wonjong Rhee](https://drl.snu.ac.kr/people/professor). Prior to that, I received B.A in [Psychology](http://psych.snu.ac.kr/) and B.S. in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.snu.ac.kr/) from [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/).

My research focuses on data-centric AI, with an emphasis on programmatic weak supervision and weak-to-strong generalization in foundation models. Additionally, I am developing techniques that enable zero-shot adaptation of foundation models without fine-tuning, addressing challenges related to data distribution shifts.
<!-- 
**I expect to graduate with my Ph.D. in Summer 2025 and am actively seeking industry researcher positions.** -->
